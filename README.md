# COT-Inventory-Management-System
The College of Technologies (COT) Inventory Management System is a comprehensive, web-based solution designed to streamline and automate supply inventory tracking and request management.

## Setup

- **Backend:** Copy `backend/.env.example` to `backend/.env` and fill in your values. Run `npm install` in `backend/`.
- **Frontend:** Copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env` and fill in your values. Run `npm install` in `frontend/`.

Never commit real `.env` files or share them—they contain secrets.
